1) MongoDB is a document database and can be installed locally or hosted in the cloud.

SQL vs Document Databases
1)SQL databases are considered relational databases. They store related data in separate tables. When data is needed, it is queried from multiple tables to join the data back together.
2)MongoDB stores data in flexible documents. Instead of having multiple tables you can simply keep all of your related data together. This makes reading your data very fast.
3)In MongoDB, instead of tables these are called collections.
